						<p>Today, anybody can make a website with Wix, seemingly for free. But top businesses know that the best strategy is to get a custom-made website. </p>
						<p>Why? Because <i>custom sites look and feel better</i>. When you've taken the time to make a website that fits your business/organization, your customers feel appreciated. Rather than having to navigate a website cluttered with the genericism of a website template, your customers' experiences can be focused and efficient.</p> 
						<p>Not only that, because templates from sites like Wix have to fit a bunch of different organizations, they have a lot of bells and whistles in their internal code. So they inherently load slowly. But custom websites can be incredibly lean, and because of that, they're more responsive and load much more quickly, leading to a better customer experience.</p>
						<p>But the biggest concern any business has is that its potential user base has to be able to <i>find</i> the business. No users, no business. So the techniques of search engine optimization (SEO) are critical to ensuring that your site is listed on the top pages of Google and other search engines. Interestingly enough, SEO works best with custom websites&mdash;sites hosted like platforms like Wix often suffer because they're associated with the massive space of Wix websites, so it's harder for the search engine to differentiate them. </p>
						<p>Make your business known, and leave a distinct impression in your customer's mind with the searchability, responsiveness, and elegant simplicity of a custom website. <b>Go custom.</b></p>

						<p>We're in 2016, but too many website designers still pretend we're in 2004.</p>
						<p>Their websites still use outdated technologies and paradigms, like Adobe Flash, tables in the use of their web design, and gradients/bevel techniques as elements of their design. Together, many of these elements are often described as the "HTML4" framework. Websites using HTML4 don't work well on mobile devices, and they're ugly, slow, and often even dangerously insecure&mdash;technologies such as Flash can seriously threaten the safety of your data and of your customers' devices.</p>
						<p><b>HTML4 is an absolutely obsolete standard.</b> Avoid the mistake of having your website made within this inferior framework, which not only sacrifices the quality of your users' experiences, but the reputation of your business itself. Instead, get your business's website created by AG Design Services to make it look immersive, modern, flat, and responsive on mobile.</p>

			<p>We don't hide our fine print by making our text smaller. Here are our common-sense caveats to the above guarantees: </p>
			<p>*Our policy on free lifetime website support is this: don't abuse it. We're perfectly happy to make small changes (i.e. minor textual edits or typo fixes) for you, but any significant redesign, like adding a page, will incur an additional fee (this fee will be negotiated on a case-by-case basis). We will resolve any small editing tasks within one week, and bugfixes will be placed on the top of our priority list. </p>
			<p>**You will have to pay a recurring fee for your domain name (about $12/year), since this fee is beyond our control. We can either handle this payment for you or you can set it up yourself directly with the domain name registrar. But so long as your site traffic doesn't exceed about five million page views a month, we will not charge you any recurring hosting fees.</p>

						<p>Hi, I'm Tanishq Aggarwal, and I'm the lead designer and founder at AG Design Services.</p>
					<p>I'm currently a senior at West Windsor-Plainsboro High School South. I've always been interested in computer science and programming since a young age&mdash;I wrote my first computer program, a version of Monopoly, when I was nine years old. As a high school student, I've amassed significant experience in programming, website, and app development.</p>
					<ul class = "browser-default">
						<li>I've gone to many technological innovation conferences/events, such as PennApps, a semiannual competition hosted at the University of Pennsylvania with over 2000 college and high school student attendees. At PennApps 2015, I developed EarLens, an augmented-reality hearing assistant app for Android, that placed among the top 15 apps developed at the contest. You can depend on the <b>quality of my work</b> for you under AG Design Services, because even under the <b>compressed timeframe</b> of events like these, I can produce <b>prizewinning code</b>.</li>
						<li>I am a Silver Divison Qualifier for the United States Computing Olympiad. Through preparation for this contest, I've gained an extensive background in efficient algorithm design, which helps the apps and websites I create to be more <b>efficient and responsive</b>.</li>
						<li>I'm the leader of our school's team in Capture the Flag (CTF) competitions, which are weeklong online tournaments that involve cybersecurity/(ethical) hacking challenges. I've led my team to several national titles, like 3rd place out of 1000 teams nationally in HSCTF 2015. You can count on websites and apps developed through AG Design Services to benefit from this experience, because these competitions have trained me to always be in a <b>security-first perspective</b>. I always write code using <b>industry best practices</b> to ensure that the websites and apps I develop are as safe as they can be from <b>modern hacking techniques&mdash;techniques that I've practiced to perfection, and therefore know how to prevent.</b> </li>
					</ul>
					<p>You can view many of my programming projects (including the complete source code for this website!) at my <a href = "https://github.com/tanishqaggarwal">GitHub page</a>. Please also feel free to connect with me at my <a href = "http://www.linkedin.com/in/tanishqAG">Linkedin</a> and <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/tanishq.AG.11">Facebook</a>.</p>
